# GenName [2024 update]

**This project ABANDONED and the repository is archived! There is no wiki, issues, future updates or no support. Sorry!**

You can still use the software. Simply clone the entire repository or download [GenName.exe](https://github.com/mrfatguy/delphi-genname/blob/master/GenName.exe) along with selected or all _*.nam_ files from [Fantasy](https://github.com/mrfatguy/delphi-genname/tree/master/Fantasty) and [Human](https://github.com/mrfatguy/delphi-genname/tree/master/Human) folder. It works even in Windows 11 (after ignoring an alert that this program may harm your PC), however executable version is still in Polish. Because, at the time of translating sources to English, I was no longer owner of any Delphi version and I wasn't able to compile English version (translation to English was made the brute-force way by text-editing all `.dfm` and `.pas` files; see [Status section](#status) for details).

There's a [web version](https://github.com/mrfatguy/web-genname) being slowly developed. But, it needs time to fluorish.

If looking for random names of a human beings (rather than some trolls and other fantasty creatures) then you can consider [Random Name Generator](https://www.namespedia.com/random-name-generator.php) from [Namespedia](https://www.namespedia.com/) or [Students of the World website](http://www.studentsoftheworld.info/penpals/stats.php3) as a replacement.

# GenName [2015 update]

Here comes my old Delphi tool that I used to generate names for games, books, poetry, avatars etc. It contains "databases" for generating many different names sets, including fantasty ones, both more and less known, and human names in many languages or from many culture types.

This program allows name generation in three different modes. Play a little bit to catch the difference.

Program comes with an simple editor, which allows you to add or update existing dictionary files.

## Database Authors

Names of original databases / dictionary files contents, in order of appearance:

- Johan Danforth,
- Laurent Dionisi and
- Nathalie Hebert.

That's all about fantasy names. As for human names, with the exception for two dictionary files for an extinct races (Gauls and Vikings, made by Johan Danforth), I'm myself an author of all these databases.

I also have aided myself a little bit with [Students of the World webpage](http://www.studentsoftheworld.info/penpals/stats.php3).

**Keep in mind that certain dictionary files maybe even twenty years old**!

## Status

Last time `.dpr` file saved in Delphi: **1 October 2008**. Last time `.exe` file built: **6 January 2013**.

I don't have access to either most of my components used in this or any other of my Delphi projects, nor to Delphi itself. Even translation of this project to English was done by text-editing all `.dfm` and `.pas` files and therefore it may be cracked. It was made in hope to be useful to anyone and for the same reason I'm releasing its source code, but you're using this project or source code at your own responsibility.

Keep in mind, that both comments and names (variables, object) are in Polish. I didn't find enough time and determination to translated them. I only translated strings.
